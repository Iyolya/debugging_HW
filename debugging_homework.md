Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
    To stop the program from executing that particular line of code set on the breakpoint, so we can examine it.


2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
    Not until we give the debugger further instructions.


3. How do we debug the next line of code?
    We chose "Step Over" at the debugger menu 


4. What does the step into command do?
    I switches to the object(and for it's methods) that we examining at the breakpoint.


5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
    The difference is the amount of codes and methods we can run and evaluate at the same time. Single vs. multiple.
